The basis of this tool was created using the *GUI Builder* plugin for NetBeans, which automatically generates most of the layout and interaction code. If any of the generated code is modified manually, it will likely be replaced the next time anyone uses the GUI designer. Because of this, it is highly recommended that you use NetBeans GUI Builder.

Please try to keep your code style consistent with the rest of the code, and make sure that all new or modified code is fully documented.

Keep in mind that the user interface is the most important part of this tool, and pull requests may be rejected if they negatively affect the usability of the tool or add features considered to be outside of the intended scope of the tool.
